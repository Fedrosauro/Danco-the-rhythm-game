# DANCO (rhythm game)

Similar to osu!mania, but you play with all the keyboard. ***The songs were just used for TESTING the game, I do not own any of the songs
that are in the res/songs/ folder. I gain nothing from them*** (except for the testing.wav song). MyFrame.java is the "main class" . There is a "score saving" system. And everything is "local" (for now). So notes for each songs are stored into files. Scores are stored into files etc.. I'm still trying to find a
better method to sync the song with notes (atm I'm using a stopwatch of this [library](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/download_lang.cgi))
But it works pretty well for now. After 10 games played the songs are still in sync with notes, ...so great. I'm still fixing some bugs and I'm starting working on graphics too, but that is going to be the last thing I do. Thanks for reading this if you've really read hihi (Keep in mind that this game is not finished yet...  )

***- backgrounds for "in game" and "scores panel" are coming soon***
***- some songs will be added soon***
