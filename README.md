# DANCO (rhythm game)

Similar to osu!mania, but you play with all the keyboard. ***The songs were just used for TESTING the game, I do not own any of the songs
that are in the res/songs/ folder. I gain nothing from them***. MyFrame.java is the "main class" . There is a "score saving" system. And everything is "local" (for now). So notes for each songs are stored into files. Scores are stored into files etc.. I'm still trying to find a
better method to sync the song with notes (atm I'm using a stopwatch of this [library](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/download_lang.cgi))
But it works pretty well for now. After 10 games played the songs are still in sync with notes, ...so great. Thanks for reading this if you've really read hihi
